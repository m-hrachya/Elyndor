# Fantasy Kingdom Simulation

Welcome to the **Fantasy Kingdom Simulation** project! This repository contains the code for a C++ simulation of a magical kingdom inhabited by various creatures like elves and goblins. The simulation is powered by modular and extensible components, enabling you to experiment and expand on the base functionality.
